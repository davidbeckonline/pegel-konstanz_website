    <title>About :: Current and historical information on the level of Lake Constance</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/en/03_about/index.html</link>
    <description>And here you can find “About” information, such as the imprint, contact details, etc. And I also want to talk a little about the background of this website.&#xA;Why Technical Realization Release Notes Contact and Imprint Logo The most important information is:&#xA;Please Note All statements without guarantee.&#xA;I’m trying to build a reliable and helpful website here. But at the end of the day it’s a hobby. All information is therefore without guarantee.</description>

      <description>Implementation This website was built and is hosted on AWS. For all regional services, the eu-central-1 region was selected.&#xA;Lambda. We use lambda functions for two activities: 1/ scrape the data. 2/ process and visualize the data. The fictions are either triggered via EventsManager or as part of a StepFunction.</description>

      <description>Why actually? This website is the result of a learning project. My real goal was to learn more about data analysis in general. I was looking for a suitable data set for this. And the level data for Lake Constance became available quite quickly. Since I grew up on Lake Constance, I have a connection to the data. The data itself is publicly accessible (#opendata). And the data set for the Konstanz measuring station is around 200 MB in size. This is a pretty ideal size, as you can no longer process this amount of data in Excel or other spreadsheet programs. But this is just tiny for analysis with Python / Pandas.</description>

      <description>Release Notes 2025 2025-07-25: added and removed notice about data refresh issues. Between 2025-07-24 at about 10pm until 2025-07-25 at about 2pm, we could not reach the API of HVZ. With that, the data could not be refreshed anymore. We added and later removed a notice informing users about the ongoing issue.</description>

      <description>Our Logo At this point a few thoughts about the logo of our website.&#xA;Since it was about data analysis in Python right from the start, it seemed sensible to put together a logo using characters. There are no pretty pictures of Lake Constance on this website. There are already enough of them. It’s all about numbers - and the graphical representation of them.</description>
