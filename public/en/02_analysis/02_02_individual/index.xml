      <description>High Water at Lake Constance The high water mark on Lake Constance is set at a level of 480 cm in Constance. In reality, however, this value tends to be low. If you look at the normal range (mean ± standard deviation), the “normal” level of Lake Constance on June 28th goes up to 472 cm. The high water mark of 480 cm is reached about every third year.&#xA;Here is a table that lists the water level with the frequency and the corresponding years. The table is additive. This means that a year that exceeded the level of 520 cm naturally also reached all the levels below it.</description>
