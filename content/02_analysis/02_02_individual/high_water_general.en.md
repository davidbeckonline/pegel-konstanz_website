## High Water at Lake Constance

The high water mark on Lake Constance is set at a level of 480 cm in Constance. In reality, however, this value tends to be low. If you look at the normal range (mean Â± standard deviation), the "normal" level of Lake Constance on June 28th goes up to 472 cm. The high water mark of 480 cm is reached about every third year.

Here is a table that lists the water level with the frequency and the corresponding years. The table is additive. This means that a year that exceeded the level of 520 cm naturally also reached all the levels below it.
