## High Water at Lake Constance

The high water mark on Lake Constance is set at a level of 480cm in Constance. In reality, however, this value tends to be low. If you look at the normal range (mean Â± standard deviation), the "normal" level of Lake Constance on June 28th goes up to 472cm. The high water mark of 480cm is reached about every third year.

Here is a table that lists the water level with the frequency and the corresponding years. The table is additive. This means that a year that exceeded the level of 520cm naturally also reached all the levels below it.
