Background analyzes of the level of Lake Constance can be found here.
We differentiate between two types:

**[1. Fundamentals]({{% relref "/02_01_basics" %}}).**

This is primarily about methodology and general considerations about the level.

**[2.  Individual Analysis]({{% relref "/02_02_individual" %}}).**

This section looks at individual events.
