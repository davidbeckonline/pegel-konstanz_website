## Release Notes

**2024-12-13: Transition to API and Seaborn for "current" graph.**
The graph showing the status of the last 10 days has been switched to API-based data. This means that the data is now accurate to the millimeter. The graph has also been switched to Seaborn to achieve a more modern look.

**2024-12-04: Go Light.**
Website back to custom Light mode.
Notice removed.

**2024-12-01: Go Dark.**
Because two sailors drowned on the way to the Iron One, we decided to turn the website dark.

**2024-11-04: Removed HVZ notice.**
Seems that the issue is resolved.

**2024-10-31: Re-added HVZ note.**
New issues with HVZ.

**2024-10-28: Notice removed.**
Issue on HVZ seems to be resolved. Removed notice.

**2024-10-28: Notice - HVZ down.**
Added info that the website cannot refresh right now due to problems on the source website of HWZ.

**2024-07-21: Updated last ten days graph. Re-corrected description of forecase graph.**
We updated the graph with the data of the last ten days. Horizontal lines for max and min had been added. Furthermore, we improved readibility of the most recent value.

Besides that, we recognized that the forecast graph we take from HVZ seems to change from time to time. Looks like, the "Scenario: No Precipitation for the next ten Days" is not displayed during high water periods. We therefore added the description of this line back in again.

**2024-06-12: Notice - Comparison 2016.**
We have added a notice on the 2016 high water as a comparison.

**2024-06-11: Individual analysis - high water.**
We have added an individual analysis on high water events on Lake Constance and their frequency.

**2024-06-09: First notice.**
In order to address current issues, we have added a first notice on the homepage. In this case, it was about the frequency of high water events.

**2024-06-01: Update frequency increased.**
Due to the sharp rise in the water level, we have increased the update frequency to an hourly update.

**2024-04-23: Icon for iOS und iPadOS.**
Added new Favicons. Users get a nice icon when adding the website to the homescreen of the iOS or iPadOS device.

**2024-04-06: Increased update cadence.**
We now update the level six times a day, instead of four times.

**2024-04-03: Add Release Notes section.**
The section you see here.

**2024-03-24: Indexed by Google.**
The page can be found on Google since March 20, 2024. We start with the 46th place for the search for “Level Constance”. However, pegel-konstanz.de is already listed as the first result when searching for "level lake constance". The more international approach might pay off.

**2024-02-19: Go Live.**
Go-Live der Website auf pegel-konstanz.de im Testbetrieb.
