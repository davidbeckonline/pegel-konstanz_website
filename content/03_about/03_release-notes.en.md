## Release Notes

### 2025

**2025-07-25: added and removed notice about data refresh issues.**
Between 2025-07-24 at about 10pm until 2025-07-25 at about 2pm, we could not reach the API of HVZ. With that, the data could not be refreshed anymore. We added and later removed a notice informing users about the ongoing issue.

**2025-07-17: Removed low level notice.**
The level of the lake is still low, but it stabilized at about six years with lower levels. Lacking time for the updates, we removed the notice. Plan is to create an automated page for this low level event in 2025.

**2025-07-02: Low Level note added back in again.**
The water level remains exceptionally low. Only three years showed a lower level at this time of the year before. We therefore added the note back in again.

**2025-05-06: Notice regarding low water levels removed.**
The water level remains exceptionally low. However, there have been ten years in which the water level was lower. Therefore, we have removed the notice from the homepage.

**2025-04-02: Added additional info to historic data and added a note about year 1972.**
We added max, min, and record information for every year in the historic data section.
Furthermore, we added a note highlighting year 1972 with a record low.

**2025-03-23: Historical values ​​added per year.**
First test with the addition of the maximum and minimum values ​​plus the date per year in the historical data.

**2025-03-06: Update of the historical data charts.**
The line charts for the years 1888 - 2024 have been revised and updated. The years 1888 up to and including 2024 are now taken into account for the long-term reference.

**2025-01-09: Transition to GitHub.**

Complete transition to API data and updated graphics based on Seaborn.

**2024-12-17: Update to JSON with API data.**
DE and EN transitioned to JSON based on API data. With that, we can provide new metrics (e.g. change last 24h).

**2024-12-13: Transition to API and Seaborn for "current" graph.**
The graph showing the status of the last 10 days has been switched to API-based data (English version only for testing). This means that the data is now accurate to the millimeter. The graph has also been switched to Seaborn to achieve a more modern look.

**2024-12-04: Go Light.**
Website back to custom Light mode.
Notice removed.

**2024-12-01: Go Dark.**
Because two sailors drowned on the way to the Iron One, we decided to turn the website dark.

**2024-07-21: Updated last ten days graph. Re-corrected description of forecase graph.**
We updated the graph with the data of the last ten days. Horizontal lines for max and min had been added. Furthermore, we improved readibility of the most recent value.

Besides that, we recognized that the forecast graph we take from HVZ seems to change from time to time. Looks like, the "Scenario: No Precipitation for the next ten Days" is not displayed during high water periods. We therefore added the description of this line back in again.
