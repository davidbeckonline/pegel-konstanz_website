## Release Notes

**2024-04-23: Icon for iOS und iPadOS.**
Added new Favicons. Users get a nice icon when adding the website to the homescreen of the iOS or iPadOS device.

**2024-04-06: Increased update cadence.**
We now update the level six times a day, instead of four times.

**2024-04-03: Add Release Notes section.**
The section you see here.

**2024-03-24: Indexed by Google.**
The page can be found on Google since March 20, 2024. We start with the 46th place for the search for “Level Constance”. However, pegel-konstanz.de is already listed as the first result when searching for "level lake constance". The more international approach might pay off.

**2024-02-19: Go Live.**
Go-Live der Website auf pegel-konstanz.de im Testbetrieb.
